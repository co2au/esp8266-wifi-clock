How to use with PlatformIO

Place your sketch as src/main.cpp (or rename your existing .ino to main.cpp and include headers as needed).

Build & flash over USB (first time):
pio run -e esp8266-clock-serial
pio run -e esp8266-clock-serial -t upload

(Optional) Upload LittleFS data
If you ever add data/ contents (e.g., seed /config.json), you can:
pio run -e esp8266-clock-serial -t uploadfs

Subsequent OTA updates (after first serial flash):

Ensure the device is on Wi-Fi and ArduinoOTA is enabled in your config.
Set upload_port in the ota environment to your clockâ€™s IP.
pio run -e esp8266-clock-ota -t upload

If you set an ArduinoOTA password, add upload_flags = --auth=YOUR_OTA_PASSWORD.
